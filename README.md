# WAFER
World Aquifer Forecast Engine and Research is an OpenSource project that uses prediction models to forecast underground water levels in the future. Currently the research is being done in Islamabad, Pakistan but the same techniques can be used for places all over the world (and it is highly encouraged by us to do it.


## Contributing
This is a project initiated by three students as an attempt to shed light on the issue. We are aware we cannot implement everything or think of the best ways to model, document, promote, develop for this projejct. This is why contribution of any kind is needed and appreciated in this project. Let us know of changes, bugs, better modelling techniques. Help write documentation for others, promote this cause, help pass better legislation and regulations in your region to combat this issue and best of all conserve water yourself.
Help to contribute to the project.
Anyone can contribute somehow by improving prediction techniques, predicting for more places, writing documentation, promoting the cause, passing better legislation and best of all conserving water yourself and raising awareness.
